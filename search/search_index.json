While you don\u2019t need to memorize this list, it is useful to have a common language.</p> <p>Tenant: Like renting a building for your business, your tenant is your private REV23 Cloud environment which includes your database, file storage, address (i.e. scrantontattoo.rev23.com), etc\u2026</p> <p>Studio: A studio is the physical location you provide services in. By default all tenants have one studio created automatically. You can add additional studios if you have multiple businesses if you\u2019d like to share data between them, or you can utilize multiple tenants for each studio to keep them separate from each other.</p> <p>User: A User is a person with access to your REV23 Cloud (including yourself). User accounts can represent service providers, managers, counter staff, etc\u2026</p> <p>REV23 ID: Similar to a Microsoft Account, Google Account, Apple Account, etc\u2026 REV23 ID is your key to all things REV23, including the REV23 website, your app, our Windows desktop software, etc\u2026 the owner of your tenant (you probably) can log onto your app with your REV23 ID without needing to specify the tenant, as we are able to automatically detect this information.</p> <p>Local Account: A local account is a User account which is stored and managed directly in your tenant and NOT a REV23 ID. Any user that is not the owner will be a local user account and will log into the app using your address (i.e. scrantontattoo.rev23.com) and their username/password.
