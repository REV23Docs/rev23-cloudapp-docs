# Piercing Settings

Objects used for piercing based services are discussed here. These objects are mostly just lookup objects, meaning simple objects you can select from a list for data consistency and so you don't need to type in a value each time. As such, there is little to discuss here as they mostly just contain a name field.

These objects are used for recording supplies used in **Piercing** [Service Sessions](../concepts/services.md), namely, *Jewelry*.
