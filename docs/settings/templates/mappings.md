# Template Mappings

Template mappings represent the link between a template and a particular service type.

For example, mapping the desired tattoo release form to the tattoo service type.

To map a template 

1. Go to **Settings** > **Templates** > **Mappings**
2. Find the desired category type.
3. If you already have a template mapped, remove it.
4. Add the desired template.

> Currently only one template can be mapped per service type. Soon we will support multiple templates that can represent multiple forms being filled out. For now, you can use template sections with the **Break Page** feature to kind of emulate this.
