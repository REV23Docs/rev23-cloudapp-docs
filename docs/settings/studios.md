# Studios

Studios in REV23 represent where you perform services. You can have one or more studios to separate your services by either physical or logical location.

By default you always have the studio that gets created with your subscription.

If you have additional locations you can add a new studio for each (we do not charge by studio, only users). Each studio has its own time zone setting, so if you have a studio in New York and California, you can view all times in their local time and not your device time.

In addition to physical locations, whether across the street or across the country, you can also create a studio for a logical separation. For example, if you want to run your piercing or PMU business separate from the tattoo business. In this case you have a shared customer/user list as well as all of your other customizations, however you can focus in specifically on that one businesses services and not be bogged down with data that you don't need to see.

When you log onto the app you will be prompted for which studio you wish to view. You can then easily switch between them from the menu.

## Security
The permissions for creating/editing these objects are controlled by the `Studio` permission set.
