# Sources

Sources are a list of "referral sources" -- where your customers heard about you or your studio.

All a source object needs is a **Name**. You can configure this list as needed and they will be shown to the customer near the end of a Kiosk session.

As this version of the app begins to mature, reporting on where your customers come from is a valuable metric! So recording this information early is always good!

## Security
The permissions for creating/editing these objects are controlled by the `Source` permission set.
