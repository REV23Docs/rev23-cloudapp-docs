# iOS Version History

## 1.3.5 (2025 Jul 31)

### Find Duplicate Customers

In the ... menu in the Customer list, you will now find a new Find Duplicates option. This will show you customers that have potential duplicates based on their last name and birthdate. Tap one to see the duplicates and decide which you want to merge.

See [Merging Duplicate Customers](../concepts/customers.md#merging-duplicate-customers) for more information.

### Kiosk Exit Change

The four corner tap sequence to exit Kiosk has been removed and replaced with an Exit button in the top right corner. This was based on user feedback that the tap sequence was unnecessary and tedious, potenitally slowing users down if they only have one device.

### Kiosk Polish

Kiosk has received some visual polish making required fields easier to identify, as well as new ways to exit and start over.

 - The start over button, previously found as a large circular button in the bottom right has been moved to the top left with a clear label as to the intent and match the new Exit button.

- Markdown support has been enhanced in Templates by stylizing your headers, bullet points and more.

- Signature is now cropped horizontally if the signature does not take the entire width of the canvas (matching the web UI behavior).

- Various improvements and bug fixes.

## 1.3.4 (2025 Jul 11)

### Portfolio Slide Show

Go to **Settings > Portfolio** to add photos or albums from your Photos app (albums are the preferred method so you can more easily manage them and share them across devices). The images will cycle when Kiosk is idle on the Welcome screen.

See [Portfolio](../ipad/portfolio.md) for more information.

## 1.3.3 (2025 Jun 1)

### Color Customization
Added color customization to users, studio, service categories and service types. Service colors are currently the most noticable, the other settings will be more subtle, but used in future updates.

- Studio: Overrides the system defined color for the studio initials. If not set will use the system generated color.
- Service Categories: Displays an indicator on lists of services with types of that category. If not set no indicator will be visible unless specifically set on the service type level.

### Service Filter
You can now filter services in the service list by status, provider, type, category, etc...

### Force Delete
Added the ability to force delete to certain objects when initial deletion fails due to business rules. For example, if you attempt to delete a service/session with signed forms you would encounter an error and have to delete the forms first. Now, if a user has a permission that would enable them to delete the object(s) preventing an object deletion (in this case `form:delete`) the first delete attempt will still fail, and prompt if you'd like to delete the related objects.
