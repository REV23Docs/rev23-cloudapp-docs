# iOS Version History

## 1.3.4 (2025 July 11)

### Portfolio Slide Show

Go to **Settings > Portfolio** to add photos or albums from your Photos app (albums are the preferred method so you can more easily manage them and share them across devices). The images will cycle when Kiosk is idle on the Welcome screen.

See [Portfolio](../ipad/portfolio.md) for more information.

### Other
- Navigation Bar is now always visible when scrolling. Previously in screens like Customer or Service detail if you scrolled to the bottom you would need to scroll to the top to see the < Back button again. This is now always visible.

- The clear signature button on Kiosk has been made larger and more clear with a new eraser icon.

- Various UI touch-up updates.
