### General

-	There are instances where things have been implemented on web but are not on iOS and vice versa. Some things, such as the Template Designer are exclusive to web right now and will be for release, meaning you need to use the web app to customize your release forms. Other minor things we are in the stages of polishing up so things will align over the coming weeks.

### iPad

- `TBD`: Complete Service button isn't currently doing anything. Evaluating its purpose based on feedback.

### Web
