# Known Issues (Release Preview)

Check this list for known issues, bugs, etc... during testing.

This list contains `BUG` and `TBD (to be done)` items we intend to fix _before_ launch. Anything not listed as such is either just a known limitation or something we will add later.

### General

1.	There are instances where things have been implemented on web but are not on iOS and vice versa. Some things, such as the Template Designer are exclusive to web right now and will be for release, meaning you need to use the web app to customize your release forms. Other minor things we are in the stages of polishing up so things will align over the coming weeks.


### iPad
1. `BUG`: **AFTER UPDATING TO build 213.0** from a previous version you will likely experience a crash. Uninstall the app then reinstall from home screen if this occurs.
1. `BUG`: On screen keyboard not showing on medical conditions that are Yes/No + Text
1. `BUG`: Investigating occasional crash when skipping emergency contact in kiosk
1. `TBD`: Complete Service button isn't currently doing anything. Evaluating its purpose based on feedback.
1. `TBD`: Assign users to studios (can be done in web for now)
