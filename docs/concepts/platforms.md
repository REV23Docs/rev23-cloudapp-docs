# Platforms

REV23 CloudApp is currently accessible from a website and a dedicated iPadOS app.

While each of these platforms are part of the same "app" they are completely separate experiences and code. As a result you may notice features or interfaces that are different from the other.

## Web
The web app allows you to access to your data from any internet connected device and a web browser. While it is possible to use it on smaller screens, such as a phone, you may have a hard time navigating some of the elements at this size. We're constantly working to improve this experience.

To access the web app you can navigate to https://`<yourdomainname>`.rev23.com.
