# Platforms

REV23 CloudApp is currently accessible from a website and a dedicated iPadOS app.

While each of these platforms are part of the same "app" they are completely separate experiences and code. As a result you may notice features or interfaces that are different from the other.


## iPadOS

The iPadOS app is a dedicated app, installed from the Apple App Store. For daily usage of artists, the iPadOS app is the best choice.

## Web

The web app allows you to access to your data from any internet connected device and a web browser. While it is possible to use it on smaller screens, such as a phone, you may have a hard time navigating some of the elements at this size. While we're constantly working to improve this experience, the web app is primarily meant for larger screens.

The web app is a great choice for desk/counter staff to interact with the app from a desktop or laptop PC/Mac.

To access the web app you can navigate to https://`<yourdomainname>`.rev23.com.
