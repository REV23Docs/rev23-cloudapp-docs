# REV23 ID

A REV23 ID (just like a Microsoft Account, Google Account, Apple Account, etc...) is your single sign-on to REV23 apps and services (i.e. the rev23.com website).

A REV23 ID is required to create a REV23 CloudApp subscription, and is able to be used as a login method into your tenant.

Subscription owners can (and should) use their REV23 ID to access their app. Other accounts you create are accessed via a username/password that are stored only in your database.

When logging onto the app you are presented with two options.

- Log on with REV23 ID
- Log on with Username/Password

It is important to pay attention to the method you select. You cannot type your REV23 ID email and password into the username and password field. You must specifically initiate this sign on using the REV23 button.

> Soon, REV23 will support inviting other artists to your app tenant via their REV23 ID.
