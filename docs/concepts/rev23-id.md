# REV23 ID

REV23 ID is your single sign-on (SSO) for all REV23 apps and services, much like a Microsoft, Google, or Apple account.

REV23 ID is used when logging onto rev23.com, leaving a blob comment, or product review on our website, or activating our Windows Desktop software. REV23 ID is required to create a REV23 Cloud subscription and can also be used to log into your tenant.

Subscription owners _always_ use their REV23 ID to access their app, while other accounts you create will use a username and password stored securely in your database.

When logging into the app, you will see two login options:

- **Log in with REV23 ID**

- **Log in with Username/Password**

Make sure to choose the correct method based on your account type. If you're logging in with your REV23 ID, you must use the REV23 ID button — you cannot simply enter your REV23 ID email and password into the Username/Password fields.

## Benefits of Using REV23 ID to Log In

Using a REV23 ID to log into REV23 apps and services provides several advantages:

- **Seamless Access**: With a single login, you can access all REV23 services without needing to remember multiple usernames or passwords. This makes logging in faster and easier.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: REV23 ID acts as your central identity across multiple REV23 platforms, eliminating the need to log in separately to each app. Once logged in, you have immediate access to all services linked to your REV23 ID.

- **Simplified Tenant Management**: As a guest or user in multiple tenants, REV23 ID allows you to switch between them effortlessly, without having to enter tenant-specific credentials each time.

- **Enhanced Security**: REV23 ID ensures your account is securely managed with modern authentication protocols, providing better protection than traditional username/password combinations.

- **Consistent Experience**: No matter which REV23 app you’re using, your REV23 ID ensures a consistent and unified experience, reducing the need for separate logins and enhancing user convenience.

By logging in with your REV23 ID, you get a more streamlined, secure, and efficient experience across all REV23 apps and services.

## Guest Artists/Users

If a user wishes to link their REV23 ID to their user account to experience these benefits, when creating the user ensure the email address of their account matches that of their REV23 ID. The first time they attempt to log on with REV23 ID, it will automatically link their accounts, thereby adding them as a guest to your tenant. They will now have the benefits of using their REV23 ID with your tenant.
