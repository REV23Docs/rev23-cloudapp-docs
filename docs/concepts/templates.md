# Templates

Templates represent the document flow of your release form. A template design contains one or more section, and a section contains one or more blocks. Additionally Templates have additional options that control the flow of the form.

A **section** is a group of blocks.

A **block** is a paragraph you want your customer to read, a statement you want them to agree to, or a question for them to answer, for example a Yes/No question, or the customer's initials.

Depending on your needs your template may have one section and one paragraph block, or it may be broken down into multiple sections with a full length questionnaire. This is entirely up to you!

While powerful, templates are easy to set up. Check the [Template Designer](../settings/templates/designer.md) topic for detailed information.

> The _Template Designer_ is currently available on the web app only. The templates you design there are of course available to the iPad app.

### Mappings

You can have separate templates for each service category type (Tattoo, Piercing, Microblading, PMU, Removal). When you have created a Template you need to [map](../settings/templates/mappings.md) that template to the category.
