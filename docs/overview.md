# Overview

This topic will walk you through the basics of getting started with REV23 from setup to your first release form. This is a very high level overview of steps just to get you familiar with the app. Please see the rest of the user guide for more advanced topics.


## Getting Started

If you are setting up REV23 for yourself as an independent artist, when you first create your tenant (our tech term for your subscription which includes your database, file storage, domain name, etc...) you are ready to get started. Our defaults give you a great starting point with a solid release form. Of course, you will likely want to personalize things to your needs, so here's a starting point.

### Service Types
Check the [Service Types](settings/service-types.md) list and ensure it properly represents your studio. For example, the default piercing list may contain things which your studio does not perform. Add or remove service types as needed.

### Users
Create additional [User](concepts/users.md) accounts for additional artists or helpers which need access.

If they are a service provider, assign them a seat and add licenses to ensure the app knows which service types they perform.

### Templates
Its likely you will need to modify or completely replace the default release form [template](concepts/templates.md).

If you create a new template, ensure you map it to the proper service categories so that the app uses your copy.

## Your first release form

From the iPad app tap the main menu â‰¡ in the top left then select [Kiosk](concepts/kiosk.md). This is where the [Customer](concepts/customers.md) will fill out the release form.

While the form has been signed, the document has not yet been generated. REV23 allows the provider to make necessary adjustments.

Exit Kiosk and return to the main app then open the in progress [session](concepts/services.md) which you'll see on the home screen.

Make any necessary adjustments such as placement, description, etc... and tap the `Start Session` link and set the time the session has begun.

Next, tap the `End Session` link and set the end time. This is the action that actually generates the final PDF document of the release form. Once ended, the session locks and cannot be modified. This is to ensure the final generated document matches what is in your database.

If a customer email was provided, a link to the PDF will be sent to them.

**Congratulations!** You've completed your first release form in REV23! Of course there are many additional things you can do such as attaching files, recording supplies, adding notes and more.
