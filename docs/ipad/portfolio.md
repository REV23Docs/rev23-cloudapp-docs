# Portfolio

When [Kiosk](./kiosk.md) is idle you can optionally have a slide show display.

To configure Portflio go to Settings > Portfolio and enable the slide show.

> The Portfolio will only start if Kiosk is on the Welcome screen with your studio logo.

## Settings

- **Enable slide show**: Turn on to enable the slide show.
- **Start Time**: The amount of time to wait while idle before starting the slide show.
- **Speed**: The amount of time each photo is shown.
- **Shuffle**: Randomly order the photos.
- **Transition**: The effect to use when changing between each photo.

### Photo Sources

You can select individual pictures from your photos or you can use an Album. Albums are recommended for most cases because you can manage them in your Photos app and share them across multiple devices via iCloud. If the app is uninstalled and reinstalled for any reason, your settings are cleared. In this case, having an album will allow you to quickly get back up and running with portfolio rather than individually selecting images again.
