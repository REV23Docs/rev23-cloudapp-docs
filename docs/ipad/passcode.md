# Passcode

[Kiosk](../concepts/kiosk.md) requires a passcode to secure the rest of the app from customers. If you do not have a passcode, you will be prompted to create one the first time you start a Kiosk session.

From the iPad app's settings menu you can access your passcode settings.

You can create/change/remove your passcode in the app's Settings menu. Additionally you can enable Face/Touch ID to bypass using the passcode if desired.

If you want to protect the app completely each time it goes into stand by or you switch apps, you can enable the **Require Passcode** option. With this option on you will need to use the passcode to open the app or resume it from a suspended state.

## Forgot Passcode

Your passcode is stored on locally on your device. If you have multiple iPads in your studio, they each can have their own passcode. If you forget your passcode you can uninstall the app and reinstall from the App Store. Your data is of course stored in the cloud so you will not lose any data during this process, you will just need to log on again.
